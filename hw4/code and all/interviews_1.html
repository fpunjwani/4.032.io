<b>Claire, Aspiring Llama at Dawn Mountain Buddist Temple</b><br>
<i>Wednesday, June 14 2018, 7:30pm</i><br>
Currently program director of Dawn Mountain in Texas.. I got out of grad school and got a PhD in religious studies. It’s surprising that you can get a degree in that field that isn't academic<br>
So, I started practicing Buddhism during undergrad at Rice… 2 communities would meet for evening meditation:  First was Thai group and with the Thai group, I was one of the English speakers so I only felt connected to teacher, but people were nice to me but I couldn't understand what they were saying.<br>

<a href="http://google.com" target="right_side">So I started practicing in Rice in the 90s. There I had a Kung Fu group with like-minded people and found some social support for it.</a><br>
In North Texas, a lot of people were along the same lines of religion, so they didn't believe in reincarnation, in non-Christian beliefs
<br>
<a href="http://google.com" target="right_side">So after 8 years of practicing, I got involved in Dawn Mountain. What drew me to Tibetan Buddhism was just reading about it and really falling in love with it. Then I thought maybe they’re not just trying to control people’s mind with this stuff
</a><br>
I was raised Christian. Very coercive backwards form of Christianity. Our llamas at Dawn Mountain are both listeners and they're both like “we're not gonna tell you what to do “ and the way they approached it was very loose and really gave the authority back to me and it was not like “here’s what you have to do to belong”.
<br>
The reason why I became more serious about getting involved was I had this great relationship ship with this llama that I used to follow and he was just invested in his students and they weren't doing it for money or some other motive.
<br>
I guess partly it showed me like a really, here are these people and their qualities. You do this training, you could get these results and some people might think they're crazy but then you meet them and you’re like oh my god.
<br>
I’m thinking of one of my teachers who I had a convo with earlier this afternoon. For instance, he just had this grounded, unflappable sort of presence and I can trust him not to get upset or defensive. It seems so normal but how do you do that.
<br>
Dawn mountain is my biggest community... I don’t think there’s anything else… I mean grad school, you all know how it is.
<br>
I have friends but they're pretty much all Dawn Mountain people.
I wouldn't say there are subcommittees but I don't think they are large enough to form organized groups. I mean, there are groups within the larger group but idk if they’d be close enough to be a community.
<br>
I do work here. I take classes here. It’s 80% great. The other 20% is like different roles and it can be very tricky because u know Tibetan Buddhism is very hierarchical… like someone may look up to me for a role because of the hierarchy.
<br>
So while i was in grad school, I just sorta realized that there was no one I’d call a close friend. It was just a bunch of acquaintances.
<br>
And I was talking to Harvey if it was okay if I was seeking these relationships and reaching out to these people for social support and you may see this as normal but if you reach out to these people and they see you in this position of power, it may not work.
<br>
The other thing…. Yeah, I don’t think anyone actually works here. I think in terms of like long term, getting emotional needs met.
<br>
Yeah, if you look at the last generation of western gurus, there were scandals, they were sleeping with their students, and they were getting a bigger perspective of their role in the community.
<br>
I feel that now … I’m also not exactly in the teacher role but some people will say “you’re my teacher”, but that’s weird to me.
<br>
I’ve actually, as of a week ago having a sense of that and I was just having baby blues and it kinda felt like it was taking over my entire life.
<br>
I’ve since fell in love with someone who is not part of the group but it’s very interesting how having this person outside of the organization gives me perspective outside.
<br>
For me, grad school was just very lonely. So i guess to larger context I was living in Fort Worth so I didn’t have any friends and my mom had just died so Dawn Mountain became like a safe haven for me because it wasn’t just one but many people.
<br>
But my socializing time was just a couple minutes to a couple hours in the week
<br>
Dawn Mountain was an emotional center also because Harvey was like a surrogate parent to me so I had him play a big role and be a big influence. I would say it’s kinda like a home. It definitely feels like a home, but it’s a home where I work.
<br>
I think it’s partly because my teachers are there so I feel very close to them and some of them I’ve know for over 20 years together, and some of them, we’ve been through very difficult experiences together, you know. These aren't just people I meet with a couple times a week to mediate. Those retreats are intense. These aren’t just people you cut out of your life
<br>
A lot of places, people talk about “oh I've been to this retreat and this one and this” but the nice thing about Dawn Mountain is that what I’ve seen in these organizations is that cliques tend to form and I saw that in the Kung Fu school…
<br>
You know to have that cliquish thing, you’re just waiting to have someone stab you in the back. That pulls down the community cuz if you can't share in a way that you don't think you'll be respected. Like grad school was kinda like this.. You can’t let yourself to be vulnerable.
<br>
I’ve seen that in many Buddhist orgs I’ve been to but one thing it had is that you didn’t have that sense of group cohesion and it felt like everyone was trying to climb up the ladder of some social pyramid… Here, it’s just like family
<br>
Sure, so I feel like even talking about community and Buddhism, there are 3 Gems, the Buddha the Sangha, and the Dharma. So in our religion, the sangha are the people who practice the religion…
