Theme,Concepts,Quote,Person,ContextSolidarity through life,Knowing people are for me,"Feeling judged by someone before they have all the facts. Like they're shaming you. It's not that I don't want to be challenged, but when someone comes up with a different story of what you've down. Like if someone comes to a meeting not having discussed something with me but with 7-8 other people--they don't have all the dots or full context, but they didn't come to me. It feels like sabotage.",Vinnie,On one of his life mottosSolidarity through life,Knowing people are for me,She went to the convention the next day and she went around to everyone she knew and she inflamed the conversation and turned it into what a horrible person I was and like: how dare I say the things I said to her.

After I go to church and I would go to temple and talk with a hindu scholar. They want me to be fixed. They actually used that word.",Monica,On coming out as Christian to Hindu parentsSolidarity through life,Receiving and accepting unbiased support,"It’s been actually tough. Now I mentioned that growing up, I was a golden child. But now it’s like I’m their biggest disappointment. Like growing up, I was the golden child. Like to all the aunties and uncles in the bay area. My mom will actually say that she's not as perfect as she seems.",Monica,On coming out as Christian to Hindu parentsSolidarity through life,Receiving and accepting unbiased support,"I actually don’t talk much with my mom.

So I have to stuff from her for her own well being.",Monica,On coming out as Christian to Hindu parentsSolidarity through life,Being able to naturally lean on people,"I have been disappointed by Chi Alpha in the past. I knew I wanted to be a course leader.

You do this training, you could get these results and some people might think they're crazy but then you meet them and you’re like: oh my god.

To guide him through the ramifications of a decision he made months ago. It's my role to hold them accountable to the decisions they made a while ago.

Doing this is not going to get you where you want to go.",Vinnie,CounselingStorage of an underlying history,,"The thing he brought up isn't isolated. It goes back to the fact he's divorced. I find that trying to listen, not just to the words but also the emotion. And trying to understand the trajectory of the situation is important. Listening to what he said he wants in the future is important to him. Listening to the facts of what comes before and after is important. Because this becomes the content for guiding what it is he has to do.",Vinnie,CounselingStorage of an underlying history,,"My friend on the West Coast has been with me for 23 years, and we would lose that shared experience.

I can't go to my parents with something in my spiritual life. But I can go to them to about med school. They know what has molded my passion for medicine. [My parents] are able to say: maybe this isn't a good fit for you. A couple of days ago I was so gung-ho about going to a army medical program. My dad told me: trust me. I know you.
